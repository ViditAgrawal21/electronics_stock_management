# Device Editing Implementation TODO

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Modified PcbCreationScreen to accept optional Device parameter for editing
- [x] Added logic to populate form fields when editing an existing device
- [x] Implemented _handleUpdateDevice method to update device via provider
- [x] Updated app bar title to show "Edit Device" when editing
- [x] Added "Edit" option to PopupMenuButton in DeviceHistoryScreen
- [x] Added navigation from DeviceHistoryScreen to PcbCreationScreen with deviceToEdit
- [x] Added import for PcbCreationScreen in DeviceHistoryScreen

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test the edit functionality by creating a device and then editing it
- [ ] Verify that BOM uploads still work for edited devices
- [ ] Check that production records remain intact after editing
- [ ] Test edge cases like editing device with no PCBs or components
- [ ] Ensure UI updates properly after editing (device list refreshes)

## Notes
- The provider already had updateDevice method, so no changes needed there
- Device model has copyWith method for easy updates
- Restructuring is handled by allowing changes to components and PCBs in the same form
